Below are [Eio](https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/eio) translations of [the code examples](https://github.com/realworldocaml/examples) in [Real World OCaml - Chapter 16. Concurrent Programming with Async](https://dev.realworldocaml.org/concurrent-programming.html). The section titles follow those in the book for easy cross-reference.
